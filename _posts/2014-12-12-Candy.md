There are N children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
What is the minimum candies you must give?

<p>Problem link: <a href="https://oj.leetcode.com/problems/candy/">https://oj.leetcode.com/problems/candy/</a></p>

<p>分析:</p>
贪婪算法  
从头开始遍历rating列表，用c[]存储每个孩子分到的糖数，c[0]。如果r[i]>r[i-1],c[i]=c[i-1]+1;如果r[i]==r[i-1],c[i]=1;否则,ratings序列从i-1开始递减，  
寻找从i-1开始的最长递减子列ratings[i:j],更新c[j-1]=1...直到c[i]=j-i.最后更新c[i-1]=max(c[i-1],j-i+1),因为这个点可能受到之前邻居的影响。
 
<p>代码如下：</p>

{% highlight python %}
class Solution:
    # @param ratings, a list of integer
    # @return an integer
    def candy(self, ratings):        
        if ratings is None or len(ratings) == 0:
            return 0
        if len(ratings) == 1:
            return 1
  
        c = [0] * len(ratings)
        c[0] = 1
        index = 1
        while index != len(ratings):
            #print(index,c)
            if ratings[index] > ratings[index-1]:
                c[index] = c[index- 1]+1
            elif ratings[index] == ratings[index-1]:
                c[index] = 1             
            else:
                start = index - 1
                while index != len(ratings) - 1 and ratings[index + 1] < ratings[index]:
                    index += 1
                i = index
                while i > start:
                    c[i] = index - i + 1
                    i -= 1
                c[i] = max(c[i], index - i + 1)
            index += 1
        #print(c)
        return sum(c)
